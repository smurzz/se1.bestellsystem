/**
 * Type to enumerate tax rates applicable for articles.
 * 
 * A selling business is obligated to collect taxes from sales based on a tax
 * rate. German sales tax (Umsatzsteuer) is collected as value-added tax (VAT,
 * Mehrwertsteuer, MwSt.) at different rates. A regular rate of 19% applies
 * to all articles, except for those with a reduced rate of 7% such as food,
 * health care items and books.
 * 
 * A VAT-system includes taxes in prices. Each business collects taxes and
 * reclaims paid taxes. End-customers cannot reclaim taxes. This creates a
 * system where taxes are collected from suppliers and distributors based on
 * their "added value" and by end-customers based on the final purchase price.
 * 
 * German MwSt. was ~243 Mrd, ~1/3 of total tax revenue of ~800 Mrd (2019).
 * See: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umsatzsteuer_(Deutschland)">Umsatzsteuer (Deutschland)</a>.
